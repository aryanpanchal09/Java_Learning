Whenever we call the object it will call the constructor of a class

But If we had use Inheritance it will call the constructor of sub class and super class both

Every constructor in java there is a method called Super 

Even if we don't mention it it's there

Super means call the constructor of a super class the default one not the parameterized one

Super Class constructor value pass extends parameterized constructor call

Every Class in java extends the Object Class

This method will execute the constructor of a same class

Super method execute the constructor of a super class
