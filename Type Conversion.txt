Topic - Type Conversion and Casting 

byte b = 127; - maximum value

int a = 256;

now if we assign int to byte it will not work 

a = b; Which will one have a bigger range will be converted means a can be converted to b but b can't converted to a 

a = b - Conversion

If we want to assign int to byte we have to convert it - It's called as Casting 

b = (byte)a;

It's doesn't support boolean, char

int x = 5.6;
float f = 6.7f;

int x = (int)f; - We will loose our decimal value by converting float to integer

Modulas

Int to byte it will convert it into module 257%256 
Number divided by Byte Range 

Now matter how big the number is when we convert byte to int it will perform Modulas and post the reminder

From Java 14 we don't have to compile the code first it will automatically do it

Type Conversion 

Suppose if we multiply 2 byte and then answer goes out of the range 
Java will change that datatype to another which support's it 

byte answer will be in Integer
