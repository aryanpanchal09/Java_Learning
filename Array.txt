Array 

int i = 5;

int - variable 
i - refrence variable 

int i = 6;
int i = 7;

To save multiple value in 1 variable we use Array
To apply array we have to use variable with [] - Square Brackets
Assign the value in {} - Curly Brackets
But we have to stick with the size of the Array

int num[] = {5,6,7};
int num1[] = new int[4];

Now we can't assign more the 4 value in Array num1[];
Array numbering start with 0 which are knows as Index number

nums array memory structure
 0  1  2  3
[3][7][2][4]
