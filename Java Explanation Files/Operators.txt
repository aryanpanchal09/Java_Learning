Arithmentic Operators
+
-
* 

/ - It will give Quotent
% - It will give Remainder

num = num + 2 // num += 2 // num++(post increment) // ++num(pre increment) -> Increment

It behaves diff when we try to fetch the value or assign the value

num1-- -> decrement

The above all are Arithmentic Operators

Now Relational Operators

= - Assignement Operators
== - To compare the value whether the value are same or not
!= - Not equal to 
<= - less than equal to
>= - greater than equal to

<, >, = 

3. Logical Operators

x < y - a >b

t/f  - t/f

We are trying to get a combine result

AND - &
OR- |
! - Not

AND OPERATOR
T T - T
T F - F
F T - F
F F - F

OR OPERATOR
T T - T
T F - T 
F T - T 
F F - F 

NOT OPERATOR 
T - F 
F - T 

X0 - We will talk about it later

SHORT CIRCUIT

&& - Use Case : If we want both the condition true 
|| - Use Case : If any of them is true it will give us true - It's called as pipe ||
! - Use Case : If it's true it will give us false
