To Print something multiple times

while, do while, for

while(true)
sout;

It will just start printing 

If we want a constant we have to use a variable

When we want to concadiante words and number we have to use the + symbol

"space" + i 

Space used in "" statement will only reflect in Result 

Nested Loop

while()
    sout;
    variable
    while()
        sout;

Loop inside loop is nested loop 

If you want to execute the code even if the condition is false then give While after the block use do then while

do - It will start even if the condition is false
sout
while() - with condition 

When to use which loop 

While loop - When we don't know how many iteration or we want to read a file from database


do While loop - When we want to execute loop atleast once


For loop - When we know how many iteration we want to perform
- Initialization value
- Condition 
- Increment & Decrement


int a = 3;
int b = 6;
int result = (~a & b) | (a & ~b);
System.out.println(result);
