For Loop 

when it's an infinite loop and we want to give all the things in one line

for()
sout;

In condition if we want value for 4 times give value 3 becuase it starts from 0 or not use <=/>=

for(int i=0;i<4;i++)

If we want specific type then we can use nested loop 

Just like we we want value increasing order suppose two values in a single loop then 

for(int i=1;i<=5;i++) // we want 5 days
sout
for(int j=1;j<=9;j++)
sout("   " + (j + 8) + " - " + (j + 9)) // it will print 9 - 10 , 10 - 11, 11 - 12 .. 9 times
