Constructor we don't specify the return type or we don't write it

We are using it to assign values before the execution of a particular method

Constructor is a special method. It has a same name as a class name

A Constructor never returns 

Just specify the modifier public, private, protector


That's how we define Constructor
public Human()
{

}

If we don't call it then also it will be called.

Because whenever we create a object it will also be called.
for ex 
Human obj = new Human(); - Constructor is called
Human obj1 = new Human(); - Again the Constructor will be called

We also do that in a formal way we declare the values in method not in a statement

In Constructor we can write the connector where our file is trying to connect with the database
