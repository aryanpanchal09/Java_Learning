String : ""

String is actually a Class
That's why we have many different methods
like 
name.charAt() - find out Index no character
name.concat(" panchal") - 2 String add - aryan panchal 

But we don't necesarily had to create object of String it simply work like other variable
It's case sensitive


String name = "Aryan"

name = name + " panchal"

stack
name|105 // it just change its value 105 - 101 and now aryan is a garbage value which can be used 
s1|103 // stored at one place used by both
s1|103

heap
aryan panchal
--
105
--
aryan
--
103



Special Area - String Constant Pool
aryan|105
Aryan|103|102

Mutable String -> Change 
Immutable String -> unchange

String Buffer
String Builder 

They both provide the way to use Mutable String 
Because by default String are immutable
